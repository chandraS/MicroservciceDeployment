A web client front end to the package tracking microservice system.

This is an Angular app, served up using nginx.

There is also a routing set up so that the Angular client can access the API gateway backend - all URLS prefixed /api/ are routed on to the API gateway container.

There are two modes of running:

-local-microservice sets up a container based local system. 
-production-microservice is for a kubernetes based system.
